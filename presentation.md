::right::

```yaml
name: Deploy Application

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 'lts/*'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy
